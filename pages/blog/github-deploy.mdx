# GitHub Actions Workflow for Node.js Project Deployment

This document explains the GitHub Actions workflow file for a Node.js project. The workflow is designed to install node dependencies, build the source code, and deploy the application to GitHub Pages.

### Giving Name to workflow

```yaml
name: GitHub Pages deploy 
```
This line sets the name of the workflow as "GitHub Pages deploy".

## Setting up the trigger
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
```
The workflow is triggered:
- `push:->branches:` specify when there's a push to the `main` branch workflow will triggered.
- `workflow_dispatch` helps to trigger deployment via Actions tab in the GitHub repository.

### Setting up the environment variables

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```
This sets the permissions for the `GITHUB_TOKEN` used in the workflow. It can read repository contents, write to GitHub Pages, and write id-tokens.

### Setting up the jobs

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
This ensures that only one deployment job runs at a time. If a new job starts, it cancels any in-progress jobs in the 'pages' group.

## Setting up the build job

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```
This starts the definition of the `build` job, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

### Setting up the steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
```
This step checks out the repository code using the `checkout` action.

### Setting up the Node.js environment

```yaml
- name: Use Node.js 20.x
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20.x'
```
This step sets up Node.js version 20.x using the `setup-node` action.

```yaml
- name: Installing my packages
  run: npm ci
```
This step installs the project dependencies using `npm ci`.

```yaml
- name: Build my App
  run: npm run build
```
This step builds the application using `npm run build`.

***In latest version of Nextjs version `npm run build` is also used for exporting it to the `out` folder. For that you also have to add the following code in `next.config.js` file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
    output: 'export',
    images: {
      loader: 'custom',
      path: '/repo-name',
      loaderFile: './src/custom-loader.js',
    },
    basePath: '/repo-name',
}
```

I have explainig the `next.config.js` file in another blog. [Next Configuration file ‚Üó](/blog/next-config)

### Upload the build output as an artifact

```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: ./out
```
This step uploads the build output as an artifact using the `upload-pages-artifact` action.

## Setting up the deployment job

```yaml
deploy:
  environment:
    name: github-pages
    url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build
```
This starts the definition of the `deploy` job, which depends on the `build` job and runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    id: deployment
    uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
This step deploys the application to GitHub Pages using the `deploy-pages` action.
