# Introduction
 
We are a growing community passionate about developing software in small packets. Our aim is to establish a standard for code writing that is easy to understand and use, much like Lego. We maintain this standard in our writing. 

As **Snapkits** believe in open source contribution, so this is documentation of our website. We try to document everything that is happening currently in the company or that we are going to do in the future. :)

## What is Snapkit?

A **simple**, **powerful** and **flexible** kit type of framework with everything a developer loves to work with.
